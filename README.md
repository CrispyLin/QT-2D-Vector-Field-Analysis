# QT-2D-Vector-Field-Analysis
The original code is retrived from http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~chengu/Publications/MorseDecomp/vfAnalysis2D.html which has to be running in VS2019 and was written years ago.

I am migrating the code from VS2019 to QT creator 6.3.1 in order to fully understand the Morse Decompsition and 2D vector field analysis.

The QT creator 6.3.1 can be downloaded from QT company's office website https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools and it's open source and free.
