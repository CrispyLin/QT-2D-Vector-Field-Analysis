# QT-2D-Vector-Field-Analysis
The original code is retrived from http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~chengu/Publications/MorseDecomp/vfAnalysis2D.html which has to be running in VS2019 and was written years ago. I am migrating the code from VS2019 to QT creator 6.3.1 in order to fully understand the Morse Decompsition and 2D vector field analysis.

[`QT creator 6.3.1`](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools): can be downloaded from QT company's office website. It's open source and free.

#How to run (migrating is not unfinished)
1. open the .pro file using QT creator (if the version is different, you need to configure the code to your setting)
2. Either click run or debug.
